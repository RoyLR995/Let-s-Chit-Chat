# Let-s-Chit-Chat

The objective is to develop a chat system using MERN stack.
M - MongoDB
E - Express.js
R - React.js
N - Node.js

**Also used web sockets for interactive messages.

A real-time chat application is a software application that enables users to exchange messages and communicate with each other in real-time. 

It allows individuals or groups to have conversations, share information, and collaborate instantly over the Internet.

Real-time chat applications are designed to provide a responsive and interactive experience, where messages are delivered and displayed immediately as they are sent. 

This means that users can engage in conversations and receive updates in real-time, without significant delays.

Note:

To whomever it may concern

Please include the nodemodules folders and the .env file while working on the application.
